BATTLESHIPS

Make 2 grids. 10*10. one above the other.
labeled 1-10 and A-J
Place 5 ships on the grid:
  5 squares
  4 squares
  2*3 squares
  1*3 squares
    drag and drop images of ships?
    ships cannot overlap
    ships can be placed horizontally or vertically
computer places same ships on grid - hidden from player

user guesses squares on click 
  appears on the smaller grid (as black if miss and red if hit)
computer returns hit or miss (based on the placing of ships)
if hit player makes another guess
if miss computer turn

computer make random guess unless hit
if hit 
  computer try adjacent squares
  if two hits, continue on horizontal or vertical
  if there are spaces nearby - can computer take information in based on ships remaining?

when ship is completely hit display sink.
make ship greyed out on player board
when either computer or player has sunk all ships display winner.
keep tally of winners?

2*2 and build up from there. 



if 2 sqares are next to each other. New image. big ship. big ship gives different response. so comp or player can try nearby. different class of hit??

choose ids on where to place it. only select ids that have the same result / 6.
string into number. access number. use math.floor.
